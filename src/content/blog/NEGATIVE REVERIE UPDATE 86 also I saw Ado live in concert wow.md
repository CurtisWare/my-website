<p>Late Patreon post this week, but its ok because I was BUSY! That doesn't mean I didn't get a lot done on the game, though! </p><p><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 86 also I saw Ado live in concert wow_0.png"/></p><p><strong>TILEMAPS</strong></p><p>Once again, making new maps and location graphics has been my main push! I'm almost done with this chapter's assets... which will mean... </p><p>TEN PERCENT DONE WITH GAME LOCATIONS! WOW! At this pace, the game should only take 16 Quadspillion more years to make, but we're truckin', baby!</p><p><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 86 also I saw Ado live in concert wow_1.gif"/></p><p>Also I had a nice lil' sidequest of making a parking lift gate and associated items that allow you to use it. I think its cute. :)</p><p><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 86 also I saw Ado live in concert wow_2.png"/><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>THE WORLD'S FIRST STORE</strong></p><p>I already coded up a store a while back, but HOORAY the first one you come across in the game now EXISTS! Here's a lil gif of the area immediately surrounding it. :)))) </p><p><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 86 also I saw Ado live in concert wow_3.gif"/></p><p><strong>OTHER GARBAGE</strong></p><p>I did a lot of assorted work last week as well...</p><p>Color palettes are now not separate shaders, but just collections of RGB amounts in a resource. Not only does it make way more sense now... I can make new palettes super easily, by just picking colors out of a color wheel. I should make the interface for actually switching palettes in-game soon...</p><p><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 86 also I saw Ado live in concert wow_4.PNG"/></p><p>The system for moving from one map to another is now way more robust, handling different kinds of gating, different dialogue paths and structures and several values that make each warp handle uniquely. It's already been well worth the effort.</p><p> Characters were also not following each other on the appropriate y coordinate, so I adjusted everyone's collision and pathing to better allow followers to follow their target party member.</p><p><strong>I SAW ADO LIVE</strong></p><p>I SAW ADO LIVE ON THE HIBANA TOUR!!! We got really good seats in the "C" section of the Prudential Center in Newark and had an incredible up-close view of the stage! Apparently, getting floor seats also netted us some swag...</p><p><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 86 also I saw Ado live in concert wow_5.jpg"/></p><p>I put the pin on my guitar case that I never use, but it makes me happy knowing it's there. :)</p><p>Getting INTO the Prudential Center was kind of a hilarious event... We lined up at one entrance... were eventually told to go to the other side of the building... stood in line until we got inside, were told our seats required us to go back out and get in the rightmost line.... stood for awhile in that one until someone told us there was another line against the building we should have been standing in... AND THEN WE WERE HOME FREE, BABY.</p><p>The set was so good too, UGH. I don't wanna give away what the setlist was, just in case anyone is catching the South American dates or waiting to catch it online later, but she played all the big ones you would want to hear AND some choice cuts that I could not BELIEVE.</p><p>10/10 experience, do see Ado live if you ever get the chance.</p><p><strong>AND NOW WHAT</strong></p><p>It's back to drawing tiles, baby. Soon, I will be done with the "Ergasia Streets" location... and it'll be on to... THE HR DEPARTMENT BUILDING!!! DUN DUN DUNNNN!!</p><p>Thank you for supporting me and I'll see y'all next week! Bye bye bye bye!!!! &lt;3 </p>
