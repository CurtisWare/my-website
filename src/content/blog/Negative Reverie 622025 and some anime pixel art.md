<p>BACK TO YOUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING!</p><p><strong>THE LAST TWO WEEKS</strong></p><p>Boy howdy, I been BUSY! Had several shows with multiple bands that I was practicing like crazy for! One of which, was our The Mountain Chiefs set at Philamoca in Philadelphia!! You can watch the whole set <a href="https://youtu.be/rzGxQV4ehOI?si=j0Fd9zny4zvaj_lX" target="_blank">HERE</a>, courtesy of my homie Karl Germ! (Who is, btw, an EXCELLENT streamer, dark souls speedrunner and all around cool guy! follow him on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/karlgerm.bsky.social" target="_blank">bsky </a>if u dare!)</p><p>My other band, ZAKU just played Porchfest on Saturday and is playing again at Milkboy on June 12th with a Coheed and Cambria cover band called The Neverenders! Show up and say hi, if you're able!! You can nab tickets at the door, or <a href="https://www.tixr.com/groups/milkboy/events/the-neverenders-coheed-cambria-tribute-139469" target="_blank">HERE!</a></p><p><a href="https://www.tixr.com/groups/milkboy/events/the-neverenders-coheed-cambria-tribute-139469" target="_blank"><img src="/media/Negative Reverie 622025 and some anime pixel art_0.JPG"/></a></p><p>Also, if you can believe it.... I was messing around before the Porchfest show and video of me wound up on the Protest the Hero instagram page... so that was kind of insane. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/twirlincurtis.bsky.social/post/3lqj4wyzv7227" target="_blank">PROOF.</a></p><p><strong>NEGATIVE REVERIE</strong></p><p>This week I finished one major villain's sprite work and I'm moving on to <em>another</em> one of the villain's sprites!! I don't wanna give TOO much away about the characters and plot... but the lady with long hair and earrings is Malorie, the Head of Communications and the woman with the shorter hair and wearing a blazer on her shoulders is Nerva, the Head of Human Resources. They're.... both terrible. Can't wait for you to meet and probably loathe them &gt;:3c</p><p><strong>ASSORTED </strong></p><p>Other than that, I have been keeping up on my Japanese-language study a little bit better this week. I set myself an alarm that goes off at midnight every day, reminding me to study. It's a super minor thing, but having the reminder DOES help. </p><p>I also signed up for crunchyroll again... I usually sign up for a single month.... watch 2 episodes of something... and then cancel my subscription... and this time will probably be no different. I thought the show Food for the Soul looked cute tho, so I've been watching that without subtitles to test my listening skills. The ending theme is such a bop, too.</p><p>I'm going CAMPING this weekend! I go camping once a year with a set of Vtuber friends and I think this is our.... fourth time? It's always a blast... but it's supposed to rain all weekend this time. BLEH! Worst case scenario, I'll just hang out in my tent and draw anime babes and Negative Reverie sprites the whole time while I eat Hormel Chili straight from the can. It's the little things. &lt;3</p><p>After I finish Nerva's sprites... I'll start waiting on my character designer <a href="https://maizilla.com/" target="_blank">MAIZILLA</a> to design the remaining big baddies so I can start working on one of the early cutscenes involving all of them. Well, I shouldn't say I'll be <em>waiting</em> on other designs, since there is plenty else I can be doing after that... building out the Chapter 2 map and designing the tilemap for Chapters 3 and 4 being maybe the most pressing. There are 20 chapters in the game, so I really better start COOKIN on drawing and designing the areas! </p><p>I beat Expedition 33 tonight right before writing this. What a game, man. It's got me wanting to play some more RPGs... I've only been playing an hour or two of video games a week recently and while that might not be the WORST thing... I do think ingesting interesting or important works of art is nourishing for the mind... so I might pick up a new one or two to crack into soon. Let me know if you have any suggestions! I gravitate toward more retro games, but I'm down for anything.</p><p>Ok, that's all I got for ya for now!! Have a good week and thank you so much as always for supporting me!! I'll see ya next week and we'll see how much drawing I got done at camp, lmfao.</p>
