<p><strong>I played a pool party yesterday!</strong></p><p>I haven't been in a pool in YEARS and buddy, lemme tell ya... I got EVERY SECOND of pool time in that I could. Here's a little breakdown:</p><p>1:00 PM Load in gear and GET IN THE POOL</p><p>3:30 PM My friend encourages me to see the band playing in the basement, so I get out and watch their 30 minute set.</p><p>4:00 PM BACK IN THE POOL</p><p>6:30 PM A band is playing their very first show, so I get out of the pool to watch their set to support them.</p><p>7:00 PM BACK IN THE POOL</p><p>8:30 Gotta get out of the pool to get ready for our own set....</p><p>9:30 Play an hour long set of jazz fusion at an exclusively grindcore party.</p><div><img src="/media/One more week of commissions and a pool party_0.PNG"/></div><p><em>I love da pool.</em></p><p>What an event! They also hired a professional chef to cater the party, so the food was <em>excellent</em>! He called himself.... <em>THE ACID CHEF</em> which is absolutely the coolest shit I have ever heard of. His burgers? Exquisite.</p><div><img src="/media/One more week of commissions and a pool party_1.jpg"/></div><p><em>It's flat-grill or NOTHIN!</em></p><p><strong>-------</strong></p><p><strong>COMMISSIONS</strong></p><div><img src="/media/One more week of commissions and a pool party_2.PNG"/></div><p><em>Commission for </em><em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gaitsnipe.bsky.social" target="_blank">Gaitsnipe</a></em></p><p>I completed two more pixel commissions this week... and now I only have two left to go!! My <em>hope</em> is that this week I can finish both of them before my work week starts and FINALLY get back to working on Negative Reverie!! </p><p>Also, I had the good fortune and privelege to work on a comm for MegRocks who is a REALLY good and pretty popular artist! I was in <em>shock</em> when I saw the commission come in and I was pretty nervous about it... but it really has popped off! I don't think any piece I've ever done has gotten so much attention!</p><div><img src="/media/One more week of commissions and a pool party_3.PNG"/></div><p><em>Commission for </em><em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/megrocks.com" target="_blank">MegRocks</a></em></p><p>OK... 2 more to go... I can do it... then it's back to GAMEDEV, baby!</p><p><strong>STUDYING</strong></p><p>This is just gonna be a constant for a while, but I'm still hitting my Japanese studying pretty hard. I've taken a few practice JLPT Listening Comprehension tests now and my results are steadily improving! </p><p>One thing I have noticed.... my results are WAY HIGHER in the afternoon and evening than in the morning... I think it takes a while for my brain to wake up.</p><p>I started reading part of a blog called AJATT (All Japanese All The Time) and it's pretty insightful. There's a WHOLE rabbithole to go down with it and some of the strategies it suggests are somewhat hardcore... but I'll bet they give you good results. For instance, I didn't think to set my computer and phone OSs to Japanese til I read the suggestion, but now that I've done it, I <em>AM</em> recognizing a lot of common terms much faster (especially ones related to using a computer, obviously).</p><p><strong>OK, that's it.</strong></p><p>As I'm writing this my whole body is really quite sore... probably from swimming so much...</p><p>I'm tempted to just go back to bed and rest more or lie on the floor for a bit... but I really oughta get started on these commissions... so I think I'll make myself a sandwich and do that.</p><p>Thank you, as always, for your continued support! Gamedev resumes SOON! (Also after setting windows to display in Japanese.... Godot ALSO displays in Japanese.... so that will be an adventure unto itself...)</p><p>じゃあ、また来週ね！</p>
