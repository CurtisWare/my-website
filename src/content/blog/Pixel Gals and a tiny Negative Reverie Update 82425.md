<p>I dunno WHAT happened, but over the last week the spirit of drawing anime babes overtook me and caused me to work harder than I ever have before! :0</p><p><img src="/media/Pixel Gals and a tiny Negative Reverie Update 82425_0.png"/></p><p>I've been getting a lot of requests to open commissions again... tbh I'm starting to seriously consider it. I feel like I'm doing too many things at once to add ANOTHER responsibility to the pile... but... hmm. Maybe just one or two couldn't hurt, right?</p><p><img src="/media/Pixel Gals and a tiny Negative Reverie Update 82425_1.png"/></p><p>Anyway, I've been GRINDING Japanese study for the past two weeks. I'm making sure to do 15 new vocabulary a day and slowly working through my backlog of flashcards. I started using the Genki I textbook and I'm on chapter 4 now. Grammar has always been my weakest point, so I'm actually really enjoying filling in a lot of the gaps in my knowledge. :)  I read about the difference between 練習 and 訓練 today, since they both mean "practice". I love looking up stuff like that. I both COULD spend all day doing it.... AND I often do!</p><p><img src="/media/Pixel Gals and a tiny Negative Reverie Update 82425_2.png"/></p><p>Also, I think the spirit of civic pride has come upon me and I insist on drawing anime babes in SEPTA swag, like the pic above. Big public transportation fan. </p><p>ALSO, I played BitGen Fest last night!! Fantastic show. The room was packed out and every band that played was at the top of their game, frfr. Have you heard of Steel Samurai? Insane band, you gotta check em out. Their guitarist Sebastian is my hero. He's maybe the best guitar player I have ever met. Big thanks to everyone who was able to come out!</p><p><img src="/media/Pixel Gals and a tiny Negative Reverie Update 82425_3.JPG"/> </p><p>Okay, now for a very tiny Negative Reverie update... it's only one thing even tho it took a long fricken time to make, hahaha.</p><p><img src="/media/Pixel Gals and a tiny Negative Reverie Update 82425_4.png"/> That's the last tileset for the second chapter of the game. I'm not good at drawing trees or bushes or flowers AT ALL, so those took some doing, for real. I also drew some moving water to go with it, but I'll post that later. I need to dedicate more time to gamedev in the upcoming weeks. My friend who is throwing a show in Philadelphia in November asked me if I'd like to showcase the game then... maybe I'll try to put something together for it...</p><p><img src="/media/Pixel Gals and a tiny Negative Reverie Update 82425_5.png"/> </p><p>ANYWAY, I feel like I was insanely busy the last few weeks... even though I have very little to show for it... at least as far as gamedev is concerned. Right now I'm REALLY feeling the bug to keep grinding on my Japanese study, so I plan to continue that, practice for the upcoming Mountain Chiefs show this Friday at Bonk's in Philadelphia and get some more Negative Reverie art completed.</p><p>I've also been floating getting back into Guilty Gear Strive or Granblue... but IDK, if I look at it honestly... I probably just don't have the time for it. The new guest character in Strive, Lucy, looks awesome though.</p><p>Anyway, that's it for now! Sorry I missed last week! I'll be better about it and that's a Twirlin Curtis 約束! Thank you for your continued support and I'll see you next week!!! Muah! </p>
