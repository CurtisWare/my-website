<p>WOWOW! I got some good stuff done this week! Mostly art.</p><p><strong>TILEMAPS</strong></p><p>More tilemaps.</p><p>So many tilemaps. So much of the work that goes into making this game is just drawing and inputting tilemaps into Godot. </p><p>BUT! The good news is I'm into chapter 3 of the game now and am almost done with it! That means after the next chapter's worth of art, I'll be 1/5th done with all the background art for the game!! (Not including going back at the end and punching stuff up, obv.)</p><div><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 11042025_0.png"/></div><p><em>The gang runnin' through one of them fancy data centers.</em></p><p>The time to show the game off to the public for the first time is fast approaching too.... Gotta take some extra time to make sure everything is nice and buttoned up! I've coded it up so that the button prompts should now naturally reflect whatever controller I decide to bring to the demo on the 22nd, but I really ought to try experimenting with it and trying to break it to make sure it's gonna work when it's go-time.</p><p><strong>STUDY</strong></p><p>HMM... I did REAL GOOD at studying early this week and for the past 3 days, I just.... <em>have not</em>. This is how it is, sometimes. I'm feeling more inspired today, though... so, after posting this I'll probably get through all my anki backlog and maybe study a little Japanese grammar. The JLPT is coming up soon, too!! It's gonna be a very busy winter.</p><p><strong>SHOWS</strong></p><p>I got 2 coming up this month! Would love to see you at either!</p><div><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 11042025_1.jpg"/></div><p><em>Playing with the The Mountain Chiefs on the 13th</em></p><div><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 11042025_2.jpg"/></div><p><em>Playing with ZAKU on the 22nd</em></p><p><strong>THIS PATREON</strong></p><p>I have been considering MAYBE just either making the Patreon free or pivoting to hosting my own updates and art and projects on a website... Still not 100% commited to the idea... but, if you have any thoughts on it, please do comment and let me know or join the discord and tell me there, if you'd rather! </p><p><em>THE DISCORD -&gt; </em><em><a href="https://discord.gg/ctg3zgcm37">https://discord.gg/ctg3zgcm37</a></em></p><p>Anyway! Been thinking a lot recently about pivoting to a more outdoor and less online lifestyle... probably would be good for me. (I'm not someone who is especially bothered by spending a lot of time online and I'd say my mental health is fairly good... I just have begun to enjoy outdoor activities and meeting people irl quite a bit more in my elderly age, lmao)</p><p></p><p>Anywho, have a safe and productive one!! Bye bye bye bye!!! </p>
