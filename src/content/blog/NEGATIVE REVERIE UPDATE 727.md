<p>It's once again time.... FOR VIDEO GAMES.<br/><br/><strong>BIKING</strong><br/><br/>I started biking to work about twice a week. I sit down at work and I sit down at home to work on projects, so getting a lil exericise in-between has been kinda nice. Luckily, Philadelphia is really nice for biking and the city has installed lots of new bike lanes in the last few years. 95% of my ride is along protected lanes, too! I... do sweat a lot while I'm biking, though haha.<br/><br/>I also bought a fancy pants bike pump that... well... I guess its just a normal bike pump, but it feels like it's made of decent material, lmao.<br/><br/>On the downside, apparently the company I bought my bike from is semi-out-of-business... I have a bike with battery pedal-assist and it looks like replacement batteries might not be available for purchase anymore... kinda lame.<br/><br/><strong>NEW VTUBER MODEL???</strong><br/><br/>I dunno WHAT came over me this week, but I got the urge to start streaming again... which <em>in turn</em> made me want a new vtuber model. I'm perfectly happy with the one I have now, but sometimes u just gotta do a lil upgrade, right?<br/><br/><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 727_0.PNG"/><br/><br/>I'm trying out a few new tricks I've learned since drawing and rigging my first model like.... five years ago? Oogh, I don't wanna think about how long it's been....<br/><br/>I also updated my Backloggd account with new games I've beaten and a list of games I would like to stream after I make my new model. You can look at my backloggd and make fun of it HERE.<br/><br/><strong>NEGATIVE REVERIE </strong><br/><br/>I'm STILL at those tilemaps! I can tell this is going to be like... half of the development time, isn't it?<br/><br/>Well, I completed the back area of Gisele's apartment complex and started working on the streets of Ergasia, where most of the second chapter takes place. The more I get into it... the more I have to go back and add more tiles, though. It feels like a never ending process... but, such is gamedev, I suppose!<br/><br/><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 727_1.png"/><br/><br/>I also started working on some lil things like working parking gates and minor things like that. I made some adjustments to the way doors and warps work, too.<br/><br/><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 727_2.png"/><br/><br/>Aside from working on the maps, I did do some minor things like adjust some item graphics, change the center-point for on-screen characters, change some of the properties of "Locker Tickets", etc, etc,.<br/><br/>Speaking of Locker Tickets, that's a whole system I haven't really started working on the code for yet... but I'm excited to eventually implement it in the game. I don't have too much to say about it at the moment, but look forward to it. :)<br/><br/><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 727_3.png"/><br/><br/><strong>SO WHAT'S NEXT?</strong><br/><br/>Today, I'm gonna scrap and rework the way the parking gate works (I dunno why I did it the way I did.... there is a much better way to implement it...) and then obviously, continue working on the maps themselves.<br/><br/>I'm also gonna continue hacking away at that new vtuber model. Hopefully, I can have it ready for streaming in a month or so! So, look out for that! (My twitch is <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/twirlincurtis" target="_blank">https://www.twitch.tv/twirlincurtis</a> in case you want to come say hi!)<br/><br/>Next week, I'll have a lot of personal stuff going on and things to do, so work on the game will probably be a lil sparse between 8/3 and 8/9. Don't expect too many earth shattering updates during that time, gomen!<br/><br/>Thank you for continuing to support me here and I hope you have a good week! It's almost time for me to go to work so... I guess I better wrap this up and get some shoes on. See you next week!</p>
