<p>Well, how about that... a lil patreon-only sketch of Vuota that I made VERY quickly aaaaa!</p><p>ANYWAY, it's still commission hell-mode time! I'm trying to get at LEAST 2 comms done a week, but with effort, I could probably do three? Anyway, I only have 4 left for now, so I should be able to get back to focusing on Negative Reverie sooner than later! Yippee!!</p><p>Not that I'm not thankful for the commissions, obviously! It's very flattering that people would want art from me! </p><div><img src="/media/More Commissions More Studying and a lil music_0.PNG"/></div><p><em>Commission for Marcie</em></p><p><strong>Is that... MUSIC???</strong></p><p>I hooked up some of my favorite equipment for writing music this week in a more compact and easy-to-use form! BEHOLD!</p><div><img src="/media/More Commissions More Studying and a lil music_1.jpg"/></div><p>I keep kicking my Yamaha mixer over and pulling everything off my desk because of the cabling, so... maybe I should do a lil more work on it, hahaha. I love the old school MIDI sound of the JV1080 and the digital drum samples on the SR16. My goal is to have MIDI data play music from these and ALSO switch my guitar patches on the fly. That way, I could perform with this set up live, without a computer!</p><p>(I attached a lil goofy riff if you want to hear what the JV/SR16/Guitar set up sounds like without any post processing or EQ)</p><p>Also, I have a show at a POOL PARTY this Saturday and I've never been so excited for something. There's like 8 bands, all-day event, all grindcore (except for my jazz fusion band, lmao) and the place we're playing has a bunch of cats, so that's pretty cute. When is the last time I was in a pool?<br/>...too long ago.</p><p><strong>BIKING</strong></p><p>I spend a lot of time biking this week. I think it might be my favorite method of transportation now. I have a Propella 9s with pedal assist and it makes hills a lot less intimidating. It doesn't propel itself... it's not a fully electric bike, but it DOES put in a lil extra work when you pedal, so hills feel more like flat ground. Good stuff. Highly recommend biking.</p><div><img src="/media/More Commissions More Studying and a lil music_2.PNG"/></div><p><em>Commission for Cereal</em></p><p><strong>JAPANESE STUDYING</strong></p><p>I'm still cramming away for the JLPT N5 in December. Something that keeps happening to me is that I see a new vocabulary come up in my Wanikani reviews <em>right when</em> it appears in something I'm reading or playing! For instance:</p><div><img src="/media/More Commissions More Studying and a lil music_3.jpg"/></div><div><img src="/media/More Commissions More Studying and a lil music_4.jpg"/></div><p>確認 came up as a vocab word WHILE I had my CITY manga in my lap! What are the odds!</p><p>Anyway, this week I've been playing FF9 in Japanese on and off, so perhaps I'll continue that.</p><p><strong>IN CLOSING</strong></p><p>Have you heard of Smooth Mario? It's a romhack that removes all the transitions between the stages so that the game plays like one big stage AND if you die you go ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE BEGINNING. Anyway, it rules. I'm gonna beat it one day.</p><p>Also, I finished watching the My Melody and Kuromi show on Netflix. The back half of that show goes OFF THE RAILS. It becomes very nightmarish, but in a good way. 10/10 I'm actually considering seeing if I can get a bluray or something of it, so I can watch it after I cancel my Netflix, lmao. Highly recommend.</p><p>OH, I also started watching Spy Family. Hilarious. I'm not 100% sure what's happening.... (I'm watching it without subtitles) but I'm really enjoying what I can piece together. The gags are pretty peak and the action sequences are sick too.</p><p>Anyway, that's all for this week! I'll try to have more patreon-only sketches and doodles and such in the future! I hope you're all having a great week! Thank you for your support and let's... ya know... do the thing! </p>
