<p>HELLO! TIME FOR YOUR WEEKLY  <s>BEATING</s>  NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE! </p><p>Ok, so... it's going to almost SEEM like a smaller post... but the truth is, I spent SO MANY HOURS working on the game this week and almost ALL of it on the battle system. It's a lot of logic stuff and small little edits to make it a lot more robust and stylized.</p><p>for instance....</p><div><img src="/media/Negative Reverie Update 1019_0.png"/></div><p>Dialogue can now happen in the middle of battle! This'll be good for making boss battles feel a little more cinematic. For instance, maybe you attack a boss that always counter attacks... now, one of your party members can chime in real quick and say "Hey! Don't do that!". Etc etc, you can imagine the possibilities.</p><p><strong>STAT BUFFS</strong></p><p>Ok, this was a doozy and took a lot longer than I expected. <br/>BUT! We now have stat buffs that work, WITH little 8 x 8 indicators to show you which stat is being buffed! </p><div><img src="/media/Negative Reverie Update 1019_1.png"/></div><p><strong>A BIG LIST OF GARBAGE</strong></p><p>OK, here's a very sparse list of some of the changes I made this week that don't lend themselves to snappy lil images or videos:</p><ul><li><p>Enemies are Godot Scenes instead of Resources</p></li><li><p>All damage and skill data are wrapped into an AttackData class</p></li><li><p>Initial speed is randomized for every combatant</p></li><li><p>HP and SP changes slide into position instead of just snapping to the new number</p></li><li><p>Level up screen more likely to show shines</p></li><li><p>Removed the BattleStateMachine Update() function entirely</p></li><li><p>Renamed several skills and changed the data contained within them</p></li><li><p>Characters always "bleed" above the rest of the characters to show blood graphics better</p></li><li><p>A little warning pops up if you try to select skills you don't have SP for</p></li><li><p>Enemies can now target certain rows or columns of characters</p></li><li><p>Totally reworked the weightings of various stats in battle math outcomes</p></li><li><p>Changed all buffs from floats to ints</p></li></ul><p>And that's just a FEW of the changes.</p><div><img src="/media/Negative Reverie Update 1019_2.gif"/></div><p>More sparkles on the Level Up screen :)</p><p><strong>OTHER STUFF</strong></p><p>I'm up to Day 11 on doing Heisig's Remembering the Kanji!</p><div><img src="/media/Negative Reverie Update 1019_3.jpg"/></div><p>I'm running into kanji that have so many strokes that it's hard to fit them all on the tiny lines of my notebook SO.....</p><div><img src="/media/Negative Reverie Update 1019_4.jpg"/></div><p>I ordered these! Excited to get them. :)</p><p>Well... I guess that's really it. There were some really big personal events that happened this week that I had to take care of and still have to do some work on, so that took up some of my time... so maybe that influenced me not getting around to much more than studying kanji and gamedev. Oh well! Life goes on.</p><p>Now that the battles work again, I'm going to start going all in on making a good demo experience for the event on Nov 22nd. Don't forget, if you're in the area, you can come play Negative Reverie IN PERSON! WOWOW! </p><div><img src="/media/Negative Reverie Update 1019_5.jpg"/></div><p>Just a <strong>HEADS UP</strong>, I will not be posting an update next Sunday, but probably on Monday or even Tuesday instead. I'm going on a lil weekend vacation later this week so I'll be doin that instead of writing a post. </p><p>OK!! Y'all have a good week and I'll see ya on.... Monday? Tuesday??? Only fate can decide.</p>
