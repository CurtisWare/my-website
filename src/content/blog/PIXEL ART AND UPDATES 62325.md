<p>It's been a week already, huh? </p><p>Hmm... somehow I feel like I got less done this week, BUT it was still hella busy with projects! </p><p><strong>PIXEL ART</strong></p><p>I figured I oughta keep my drawing skills at least <em>somewhat</em> sharp and made a point to draw a lil this week! I came up with the Tohru fanart above and this pic of Penny from Endless Monday:</p><p><img src="/media/PIXEL ART AND UPDATES 62325_0.jpg"/> I think I went a week or two without doing any art, so it was good to get back in and create a few more.</p><p><strong>KEYCHAIN ROMANCE</strong></p><p>That's RIGHT! I spend a good amount of time working on my Thumby dating game this week! I haven't done much python coding in a while, so it was a shock to get back into it and really start cranking out some good functions and effects! </p><p><img src="/media/PIXEL ART AND UPDATES 62325_1.PNG"/> I had a <em>mostly</em> functional version of the game before, but I didn't understand anything about classes or structuring a program, so I've completely recreated it from the ground up utilizing a scene manager and only calling 2 or 3 things per main game loop. It's a different way of thinking, for sure, but it's much more similar to what I've been doing in Godot for Negative Reverie!</p><p><img src="/media/PIXEL ART AND UPDATES 62325_2.gif"/> </p><p>At this point, I THINK I have all the graphics re-added to the new project, at least. In the original, the graphics were stored as long bit-arrays in the main project itself, but now they're all stored separately, in their own folder and are only called once the game wants to utilize them! I also wrote a small python script to strip out all the unnecessary brackets and various syntax from the dialogue I had already written, so it fits in much nicer now.</p><p>Next up for this project will be re-writing the dialogue parser and building a text-display engine, which.... while I know how it's supposed to work now... is gonna be a pain in the butt, haha! I don't want to start it! Maybe I'll be so put off by the prospect of working on it, that I'll work more on Negative Reverie instead...</p><p><strong>ZAKU ALBUM</strong></p><p>Our audio has been sent to the people mixing and mastering it! I know I've said this before, but this time <em><strong>all the guitar is really, actually, finally recorded for REAL this time</strong></em>! It's no longer in our hands, so even if I wanted to go in and change things.... its too late now!! Look forward to hearing our first full-length album sometime in late-summer/early-fall!</p><p>Our next show is July 5th at Kung-Fu Necktie in Philadelphia!</p><p><strong>JAVASCRIPT</strong></p><p>Oh right!!! I literally almost forgot about this!!! (I had actually already written the rest of this post before coming back and adding this, lmao) The reason I felt like I hadn't accomplished as much this week.... was because I spent 20+ hours going through an online Javascript course!! For about 5 days I was CONVINCED I wanted to get a different job doing full-stack web development... and idk, maybe I still do... but I do like my job... so man, idk. ANYWAY, I do feel pretty accomplished about it and I just now made myself feel a lot better by remembering how much effort I put into it! </p><p><strong>OTHER THAN THAT....</strong></p><p>Other than that, I've been cramming my Japanese-study in wherever I can. I think I'll be leveling up in wanikani <em>tonight</em> and finally get some new kanji in my deck to learn! I also feel like I'm FINALLY being able to at least keep up with the subject of a conversation when I hear it being spoken in games, shows, streams.... Maybe after I post this, I'll boot up my Japanese copy of FFIX and see how much I can understand of that... or Breath of Fire III or... whatever.</p><p>I started watching a little of Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid... that show just a lil bit horny, haha. All the characters are very cute tho :) and I think I understand a decent portion of what's going on. I like that Fenrir is bad at the in-universe Dark Souls.</p><p>One more month of night shift... I do enjoy having all the free time that it provides, but I do think I'm getting a little burnt out on it. Kinda stoked to go back to days, soon. Night shift work IS good for catching Japanese vtubers on YouTube, though. I've been getting a lot of listening practice that way, at least.</p><p>Anyway, time continues it's brutal march forward. Time to play a lil PS1 and relax for 30 min before the guilt of not being productive kicks in and I go back to working on my games, haha. See y'all next week! Thank you so much for continuing to support me!!! </p>
