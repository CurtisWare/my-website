<p>EH, not too much happened with the game this week. I got a lot of <em>small</em> things done... but nothing earth-shattering. I'm still mostly working on the battle system and trying to make it more modular and robust.</p><p><strong>THE UPDATE</strong></p><p>Unlike the previous iteration of the battle system, the portraits in the upper left corner that show the turns coming up are now their own Godot scenes. This will let me do things like highlight the portrait of the enemy or character you're targeting, perform animations on the portrait, etc etc. Just some extra juice. :)</p><p>I also changed all the input handling over to the state machine. That way it's easier to find and diagnose issues with any individual input. A state checks whether or not it's currently active... if not, it ignores input, if so, it runs down a list of phases that it can be in, finds the one it's currently in and applies inputs according to that phase.</p><div><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 1012_0.png"/></div><p>I have about 50 days to make sure I get the battle system totally buttoned up and make a little area for a player to run around in to be ready for the live demo on Nov 22nd. I'm pretty confident I can make it happen.... but I definitely don't have the leeway to be dawdlin'.</p><p>Also, here's a SPECIAL PATREON ONLY PIECE OF INFORMATION FOR YOU!!!!</p><p>Mai sent me some first draft designs for 2 new characters in Negative Reverie... Who are they? What it their part in this story? More details to come...</p><div><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 1012_1.png"/></div><p><strong>JP STUDY</strong></p><p>I spend a lot of time studying Japanese this week and started going through Heisig's Remembering the Kanji. It's an old school way of memorizing the meanings of the kanji (not the readings) and it requires use of pen and paper... but I think it's working AND it's a nice meditative thing to do during my day. If I do 25 kanji a day... I'll have 100% of the Jouyou kanji learned by the end of the year! I might have to switch to 15 ~ 20 eventually though.... the process DOES take a decent bit of time....</p><div><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 1012_2.jpg"/></div><p>Both of the kanji for the "bizarre" in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure were in my set of 25 yesterday. :) 奇妙</p><div><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 1012_3.jpg"/></div><p>Speaking of Jojo's... I made some pixel art this week, too.</p><p><strong>RUNNING</strong></p><p>God help me, I started doing some mild training for a 5k run...</p><p>I'm not FULLY COMMITED to the idea, but I do need to get exercise and having a clear goal has been helping me get off my butt and be active. I've done 4 days of training thus far and IDK if I'm seeing any improvement yet but.... I guess the fact that I'm not as put off by the idea of running now is a success all it's own. We'll see how it goes.</p><p><strong>OK GOODBYE</strong></p><p>That's all I got for this week!! Gonna keep grinding on JP study and working on this battle system!!! Hopefully I'll have enemy turns and special skills working by the end of the week.... we'll see!!! OK talk to y'all later, have a great and safe week!!! </p>
