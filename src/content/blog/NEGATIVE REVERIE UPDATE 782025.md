<p>Holy MOLY I been busy recently with shows, friends visiting from out of town, working extra hours.... etc etc...</p><p>But is that just an excuse for not getting more done on Negative Reverie?</p><p>Yeah, kinda.</p><p>NONETHELESS, we did ball a little bit.</p><p><strong>TILEMAPS</strong></p><p>This is where I put most of my energy in. I finally finished up the 1F tilemap of the FreedomHeights apartment building and actually added the working map into the game.</p><p><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 782025_0.PNG"/></p><p>Also, I drew tiles for the most important location of all... THE BATHROOM.</p><p> <img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 782025_1.PNG"/> I have some time tonight, so I think maybe I'll actually add this location to the game and begin to navigate the possible horror that is creating a reflection of your party members in the mirror. I think I know how to do it.... but we'll just see won't we.</p><p>I also added a little bit of flavor text to different parts of the first 2 chapters of the game. Minor stuff, but it should paint a better picture of the world.</p><p><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 782025_2.png"/></p><p><strong>ZAKU STUFF</strong></p><p>We're (my band ZAKU) playing BITGEN XIX at the Ottobar in Baltimore Maryland on August 23rd! </p><p><img src="/media/NEGATIVE REVERIE UPDATE 782025_3.png"/></p><p>We're gonna be debuting TWO new songs at it, so that's super exciting. :) You can visit the website for more details about it <a href="https://www.bitgengamerfest.com/#bg-home" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p><strong>OTHER JUNK</strong></p><p>Now, to be fair... I've been kinda lazy on working on Negative Reverie for a while now... I've been REALLY focusing on my Japanese studying and watching Breaking Bad for the first time. What a show, holy moly. I just finished season 4 and it was one of the best things I've ever seen. I also started playing Breath of Fire 3 in Japanese and I think it's riiiiiight at the skill level for me. I can read most sentences decently well and look up 1 or maybe 2 things per dialogue box. It's nice. Great looking game too! </p><p>I'm feeling a little low energy this week... I've been sleeping WAY too much and I think it's for recovery from being so busy, but I'm ALSO going on a trip this weekend too AND trying to flip my sleep schedule again, so... the future is lookin like more of the same. I'll try to get as much done as I can. I need to LOCK IN and start getting some REAL work done again. I'll do my best!</p><p>Thanks for continuing to support me, even during a bit of a lull.... I really appreciate it! I'm gonna do my absolute darndest to have some more significant updates soon! Maybe some more art too! Have a good week and I'll probably post again next Monday or early Tuesday instead of Sunday, since I'll be out of town then. Bye bye bye!!! </p>
