<p><strong>PIXEL COMMISSIONS COMPLETE</strong> </p><div><img src="/media/FINALLY BACK TO GAME DEV_0.png"/></div><p><em>Commission for </em><em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marumalandra.wtf" target="_blank">Maru Malandra</a></em> </p><div><img src="/media/FINALLY BACK TO GAME DEV_1.png"/></div><p><em>Commission for </em><em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/catgirl.cam" target="_blank">Terathiel</a></em></p><p>...and just like that, my pixel art commissions are finally DONE!!! Now it's back to working on Negative Reverie. But what ELSE have I been up to, you ask?</p><p><strong>SHOGI! SHOGI! SHOGI! </strong></p><p>BOY HOWDY, I have been getting INTO Shogi. I'm waking up and doing Tsume puzzles every morning... reading shogi books... AND, I've even starting streaming some Shogi!</p><div><img src="/media/FINALLY BACK TO GAME DEV_2.jpg"/></div><p><em>I play live on </em><em><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/twirlincurtis" target="_blank">twitch</a></em><em> sometimes... come play with me sometime!</em></p><p>I was even looking at the possibility of getting a real Shogi board... but... they can be a little expensive. I think I'm gonna keep going for a while and I'll nab one if I'm still playing in a few months, haha. There's also the oldest Shogi club in America very near my house! But... they haven't made any posts on social media for 4 years... I wonder if they're stlil playing... I'll have to email the club leader, I guess.</p><p><strong>I HAVE A DISCORD</strong></p><p>THAT'S RIGHT. I finally made a personal discord. It didn't feel right to continue using the Every F'n FF (my final fantasy podcast) for Negative Reverie updates, Patreon announcements, Shogi, etc etc.</p><p>You can join it <a href="https://discord.gg/ctg3zgcm37" target="_blank">HERE</a>, if you'd like to.</p><p>I'm keeping it pretty sparse; There're only channels for Shogi, Japanese practice, Negative Reverie and a general chat. Nothin' too complicated, no "music" or "game" channels or whatever. It's mostly a place where you can go to do a few specific things:</p><ol><li><p>Get the latest Negative Reverie updates (which... as a Patreon member, you'll already be getting those here).</p></li><li><p>See upcoming ZAKU and THE MOUNTAIN CHIEFS live shows.</p></li><li><p>See all of the art I make in one place.</p></li><li><p>Talk about Shogi or Japanese practice.</p></li></ol><p>SPEAKING OF WHICH, we got a HOT upcoming show, so definitely mark this one in your calendar.</p><div><img src="/media/FINALLY BACK TO GAME DEV_3.jpg"/></div><p><em>What a heater.</em></p><p><strong>NEGATIVE REVERIE</strong></p><p>Ok, big apologies for not having worked so hard on the game recently, but I have finished with my other works and I'm READY TO GET GOIN AGAIN!!!</p><p>As an offering to you, my patrons, here is a little comic I drew that explains the plot of the whole game:</p><div><img src="/media/FINALLY BACK TO GAME DEV_4.png"/></div><p><em>They're friends. :)</em></p><p>Anyway, I did download Godot 4.5 as well... I don't think there's anything in there that will really affect the game or my process... but, I do like to see all the Godot updates. It's a really good engine and I'm always excited to see what they're up to.</p><p><strong>NINTENDO SWITCH 2</strong></p><p>I got one. </p><p>Embarrasingly, I have only played Switch 1 games on it thus far... but I'm really looking forward to getting and playing Donkey Kong. I'll let u know how it goes.</p><p><strong>THANK YOU</strong></p><p>Thank you so much for continued support!!! I'm excited to finally get back on the gamedev grind! WAHOO WAHOO!</p>
