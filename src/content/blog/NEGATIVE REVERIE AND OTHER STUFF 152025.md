<p>WOW!</p><p>Happy New Year!!!!</p><p>Instead of making this post a list of updates, I'm just gonna quickly hit on the events from the end of the year!! Not a ton of actual gamedev got done, but I did do a lot of art and musical work!!! <br/><br/>But, most importantly....</p><p><strong>THE PLOT IS FINISHED</strong></p><p>WHEW! I finally got through plotting out the plot of Negative Reverie! The script dialogue isn't 100% finished yet, but the overarching series of events is complete! </p><p><strong>I wrote a song!</strong></p><p>I got kinda into Sharp x68000 music over the last week or so and decided to try my hand at writing some!! I think it went well! You can hear what I came up with here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5efuNRxAQs&amp;lc=Ugz8tOqa7v-ZbCzR4Z54AaABAg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5efuNRxAQs&amp;lc=Ugz8tOqa7v-ZbCzR4Z54AaABAg</a><br/><br/><strong>Made a VGEN account!</strong></p><p>I wanted to make a lil extra money this week so I opened up pixel art commissions! Luckily, all the slots filled up within the hour! I also got some requests from some vtubers I really like... Anyway, you can check out my vgen page here: <a href="https://vgen.co/TwirlinCurtis" target="_blank">https://vgen.co/TwirlinCurtis</a></p><p></p><p><strong>WHAT'S NEXT?!</strong></p><p>Well, at this point I'm obligated to bang out these commissions as fast as possible, so Negative Reverie dev has to take a backseat to that for a week or two. So, expect less explicitly Negative Reverie posts in January, but I'll still be working on things and will make posts here about them! Thanks for your support as always!!! I hope 2025 goes great for you! </p>
