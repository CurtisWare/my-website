<p><strong>HELLO</strong></p><p>Ok, I got a short one for you this week. I didn't get a lot of time to work on NR what with work and study AND taking a trip this weekend, but I did get a little done!</p><p>Namely, the game now reacts to whatever controller you have plugged in and adjusts the button prompts automatically!!! (Except the R1 button prompt cuz that's separate.... but I'll fix that this week or next)</p><p>How exciting.</p><p>MOSTLY though.... I went to Busch Gardens, yay how fun.</p><div><img src="/media/tiny widdle negative reverie but mostly other things update 10282025_0.jpg"/></div><div><img src="/media/tiny widdle negative reverie but mostly other things update 10282025_1.jpg"/></div><div><img src="/media/tiny widdle negative reverie but mostly other things update 10282025_2.jpg"/></div><div><img src="/media/tiny widdle negative reverie but mostly other things update 10282025_3.jpg"/></div><div><img src="/media/tiny widdle negative reverie but mostly other things update 10282025_4.jpg"/></div><div><img src="/media/tiny widdle negative reverie but mostly other things update 10282025_5.jpg"/></div><div><img src="/media/tiny widdle negative reverie but mostly other things update 10282025_6.jpg"/></div><div><img src="/media/tiny widdle negative reverie but mostly other things update 10282025_7.jpg"/></div><p>I haven't been to any kind of amusement park in like.... geez maybe 15+ years, so it was good to experience one again. I rode a few rollercoasters, but my old man body did not enjoy them as much as I remember, haha. Ain't that the way. Maybe I should have kept to the teacup ride.</p><p><strong>STUDYING</strong></p><p>I got my Japanese practice stationary and brush pen! </p><div><img src="/media/tiny widdle negative reverie but mostly other things update 10282025_8.jpg"/></div><p>Using the brush pen definitely takes more control than a normal pen and forces me to slow down quite a bit. It's bad for getting my studies done in less than an hour.... but it's actually pretty good for helping me to focus on the characters. I haven't done 25 every day like I planned, but I'm averaging about 15 a day at this point and I think that's decent. I probably should get it up to <em>at least</em> 20 a day, so it doesn't take me 6 months to get through all of them.</p><p>I also took a practice JLPT exam and I did... significantly worse than I thought I would, hahaha. Oh well! There's nothing to do about it except continue to practice and study and immerse!</p><p><strong>yeah</strong></p><p>Ok, that's all I really have this weekend, I hope everyone is doing well! I'll keep working on the game this week, starting tomorrow and hopefully have something more substantive next week! The game is about ready to show off at Stage Clear III, so I don't need to worry TOO much now. It's about time to get back to drawing locations! </p><p>Anyway, have a good week and stay safe out there! See y'all next week!!! </p>
